    <p>Reading time : Less than 20 minutesSuppose you own a web domain, the first thing you ought to do is that to setup a website for it. The second thing is highly probably, setting up an e-mail system. By an e-mail system, what I mean is a complete system that typically has the following capabilities.Send &amp; Receive emailsRead and create emailsDelete emails
Filter unwanted emails
Create/Delete email accounts
When you want to do all these, your first choice is to look for providers such as Google Apps, Outlook.com, Freemail, Zoho etc. Some of them provide free pricing plans and upto 10 email addresses in their free tier. All of them include webmail capability, so you do not need an email client on your local machine. Mails can be managed from a web application provided by them. Without a doubt, Google is the best among these providers and they have an awesome webmail interface similar to Gmail. An year ago, they have removed the free plan, and my next option was Outlook.com since their service appeared to be almost in par with Google’s and slightly better than Zoho’s. And, now that they have removed their free service as well, I need to switch to another. Now, most of the times, you might not be able to retain your old e-mails unless you back up everything regularly. Often this is not the case, and I cannot afford another move. So, I decided to setup an email server on my own as I write this article down. My plan is to document each step as I do it, so you can follow this to setup yours as well.Step Zero - Prepare a Server (Optional if you have one already)If you have a static public IP and a decent server machine, you are good to skip this step. In my case I didn’t have one, and I built one on Amazon EC2. Basically it is a virtual server, having all the capabilities of a normal server. I can access the machine using SSH from my local machine. Setting up an EC2 instance is very easy, and I chose to run Ubuntu 14.04-amd64 server edition on my server instance. Its basically a t2-micro type instance and it is free of cost for upto 750 hours of usage per month. I’m not quite sure about its running expense for a long term use, since I’m using one for the firs time. Down the line I will try to update this article when I start getting my invoices from Amazon.You must also have an MX record in your domain’s DNS zone file pointing to your designated mail server. Open your domain setting and find the DNS zone settings. Then remove all the MX records there and fill the following data.Host : Leave it blank or input @ Mail Server Name : your_mail_server.yourdomain.comPriority : 10TTL : Lowest valueThis will take s a few minutes to propagate. So you can proceed to the next step and you can check if the servers has picked up your new MX by the following command from your local machine.dig mx yourdomain.comStep One - Install Postfix SMTP ServerA mail systems is indeed a composition of a couple of tools. The following list includes the most basic componentsAn SMTP server
IMAP / POP3 server
Authentication System such as SASL (Optional)
Webmail (Optional)
The SMTP server is the core of an e-mail system. It provides the basic capabilities of sending and receiving mails based on a protocol called Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). There are many SMTP server solutions ranging from the simplistic OpenSMTPD to Haraka a super fast node.js SMTP server. We are going to use the Postfix SMTP server for this article. Postfix is free and open source. To install postfix, execute the following command on your Ubuntu server.sudo apt-get install postfixYou will be presented with two questions typically. For the first question General type of mail Configuration select Internet Site. The second question will be to set a System mail name. Input your domain name there, say for example mydomain.com, and you are good to go. If any other questions are asked, leave them out with default configurations.Step Two - Create a User AccountThis unix user will be the owner of the virtual mailbox. The reason why we have virtual mailboxes is that, we cannot create new unix accounts our server every time a new email address is required. So all mail addresses will be having their inboxes in this one single virtual mailbox.sudo groupadd -g 5000 vmailsudo useradd -m -u 5000 -g 5000 -s /bin/bash vmailStep Three - Configure Mail DomainsWe have to define for which domains this email server is going to be setup. So that it can receive mails designated for those domains. In my case it is just for one domain. sudo touch /etc/postfix/vhostssudo echo yourdomain.com &gt; /etc/postfix/vhostsStep Four - Assign mail foldersNow create file that describes which folders we are going to use for storing emails for each mail addresses. Each mail address should have one specific directory and you can point multiple addresses to a single inbox if required. Execute the following commandsudo vim /etc/postfix/vmapsand input your mail addresses and corresponding mail directories. My vmaps file looks like the following.subin@mydomain.com     mydomain.com/subinnapster@mydomain.com  mydomain.com/subinsales@mydomain.com      mydomain.com/salesWe need to hash this file to be used by the postfix system. If in the future, this file is edited for including more email maps, be sure to run the following command then as well.sudo postmap /etc/postfix/vmapsStep Five - Configure PostfixNow from the useradd command, default home folders will be created by the system as /home/vmail. This folder is going to be our virtual mailbox base directory. Now open /etc/postfix/main.cf and add the following lines to it.home_mailbox = Maildir/virtual_mailbox_domains = /etc/postfix/vhostsvirtual_mailbox_base = /home/vmailvirtual_mailbox_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/vmapsvirtual_minimum_uid = 1000virtual_uid_maps = static:5000virtual_gid_maps = static:5000More that the uid and gid should match what we used in step two.Step Six - Test your Mail serverRestart the postfix service and try out a test mail inwards and outwards. Make sure the MX record is now up and pointing to this server. use the following command to send a test mail from this machine.sendmail somemail@gmail.comfrom: sales@yourdomain.comHello, this is a test mail.The dot[.] at the end tells the sendmail command that you are done with the email body. Now somemail@gmail.com will have one mail in its inbox. Now try sending a mail back to sales@yourdomain.com and which will be present in the following directory after a few minutes. /home/vmail/yourcomain.com/sales/new If any of these two does not work properly, you missed some steps in between, or the configuration is incorrect. Now you have a fully functional email server ready to send and receive mails from and to any networks. But this setup is a very minal one if you are planning to use it for your professional requirements. In that case you also need another layer called Mail Access Layer. So that you can read/write and send/receive mails in a lot more efficient way. I will covering up this in the next article.</p>

<p>Happy hacking…</p>
