    <p>Reading time : Less than 30 minutesIts been a while I was thinking to post an article about broadcast receivers. I have done a number of projects which makes extensive use of broadcast receivers. There are a number of use cases where broadcast receivers are highly usable as well. Lets see how broadcast receivers can be made use of in Android. In layman terms, broadcasts are like a message that is sent across the entire system. Anyone with the appropriate address and permission can read the broadcast-ed message. For the sake of simplicity, I’m dropping out the concept of permissions. Basically you can catch broadcasts using a Broadcast Receiver with correct address or action as called by Android guys :). The word address in the context of broadcast receivers refers to an Intent Filter, by means of which, anyone can receive broadcasts that comes under that filter. Lets start with Intent Filters. Intent Filters can be defined in your Android application in two ways.
In your Java files through android.content.IntentFilter class
In your manifest file, using the <intent-filter> tag
Note, that you cannot typically use an Intent Filter defined in the manifest through any Java files or vice versa. Or atleast I don’t know if that is possible. Anyway, it is safe to say that, you can use Intent filters defined in your java files to create broadcast receivers that has an Activity scope, and you can use manifest based filters to create receivers that has the Application context. So it turns out that, you can create two types of broadcast receivers.
Broadcast receivers with application context.
Broadcast receivers with Activity context.
To enable a broadcast receiver, you need to register it per se. As explained above, you can register it for the entire application by registering it through the manifest file, or you can register it inside any activities you need to receive broadcasts. Before going into depths of the same, lets see how to send a simple broadcast.

Ok, there is a hell lot of variants for the broadcast sending function. For now, lets check out the simplest one, that is sendBroadcast(Intent intent). This method takes an intent as the parameter. Lets see how this can used in a typical condition.
https://gist.github.com/subinsebastien/7462190
This is simple huh? It sends a simple broadcast with an action string ACTION_HELLO as the so called address. This simply means that, any broadcast receiver with intent filter set to ACTION_HELLO can receive this broadcast. Lets create such a broadcast receiver.
https://gist.github.com/subinsebastien/7462046
Ok, it still doesn’t says what intent filter this receive is planning to use. So we have to enable or register this broadcast receiver to do that. As we have seen earlier, we can register it for the entire application or we can register it for just one activity. For registering it for the entire application, you need to add the corresponding entry into the manifest, inside the <application> tag.
https://gist.github.com/subinsebastien/7462053
And for doing the same inside an activity, you can do it simply as follows. Remember, this particular receiver will work only if the activity is visible and it cannot receive any broadcasts if the activity is not in the foreground.

Ok, this part needs a little bit of explanation. We may simply register this receiver in the onCreate() itself. But in that case, there is a risk of leaking memory if the activity is killed or has moved to the background. To avoid this, I register the receiver inside the onResume() and safely unregister the same from inside the onPause(). As you might know, onPause() will be triggered when the activity is about to go to the background. A complete sample project is available here for downloading and testing out broadcast receivers.</application></intent-filter></p>
