    <p>Reading Time : Less than 10 Minutes
In this post, I thought I would share a few utility functions for Android Developers. These are indeed used by me in different projects. My plan is to keep updating this post as new utility functions are found across. Please note that, not all the code is mine, but I borrowed from different people around the globe. So credits goes to them as well. So far the list of functions includes the following.
Check if the phone is connected to the Internet
Get EXIF rotation information of an Image
Get a view object from a layout id
Convert pixels to dp (dip)
Create a file object with correct media type, and handle name conflicts.
Get the width of the screen in pixels
Get a scaled bitmap from another
NB : The description about the function is followed by code snippets for each.
ConnectivityLets begin with the connectivity check function. The function uses the Connectivity Manager class to check whether the phone is connected or not. Please do keep in mind that it does not really checks out about Internet connectivity, but it just checks if the phone connected to a WiFi or your mobile data network. For finding if the Internet connection is working or not, you really have to make a network request from the phone.

<p>EXIFYou can read more about EXIF information of images from the wiki. In some situations it is handy to check out that an image is rotated either clockwise or anti-clockwise. I don’t exactly remember the degrees of rotation, but you definitely can read about it from the Internet. The following function returns the actual rotation degrees of an image being passed. You can apply different methods to rotate an incorrectly oriented image back to the original position.

<p>View InflationThe next function is very simple, but it saves a lot of time fiddling around views inflation when dealing with adapter views such as lists or grids. It is not a function as such, but a time saver in fact.

<p>Pixels to DPsYet another handy function which is particularly useful for people who deals with UI for pixel perfection. The name explains it all. You can read more about graphic units in Android here.

<p>Media FilesCreating files is very useful when you are dealing with Camera on the device. Most camera intents accepts a file object which will be used to write the taken picture or video to. The following function returns a file object with proper names and file type.

<p>Screen WidthThe following function is useful for UI designers as well. This function returns the width of the screen in pixels. You can modify it to find the height as well.

<p>Bitmap ScalingAnother very useful function is the one for scaling bitmaps. We usually get big sized bitmaps, and we need to scale them down to match the memory of the device. There wont be a single developer who never had an OOM error due to high sized bitmaps. So here we go.

<p>Hope that all the functions works fine on different API levels. Always check the date of this blog-post before copy pasting the code. There might be a more efficient version of each of these functions.//See you in the afterlife…//Subin Sebastian</p>
