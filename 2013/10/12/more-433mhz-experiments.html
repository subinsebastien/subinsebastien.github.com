    <p>Reading Time : Less than 10 minutes
Lately I was onto more experiments with the 433Mhz serial communication modules. I have purchased two different pairs of 433 modules which is shown in the image below.</p>

<p>My initial plan was to use a pair of encoder and decoder from Holtek to connect the two end-points to peripherals. Infact, that is just a cost effective method to implement remote controlled applications such as car-locks or automatic-gates. Those ICs are indeed not very flexible in the sense that, if we want to connect a large number of devices through this channel, it is quite difficult. Holtek’s (en)decoders provides upto 12 bits to be transmitted over to the other end. Out of which atleast 8 bits are address bits, and the remaining can be used as data bits. Generally these ICs provides, 2^12 = 4096 devices to be linked through this channel. But the problem with this implementation is that, if all the 12 bits are used to address devices, then there is no room for sending the actual data. If we take N bits out of 12 for sending data, the number of devices that we can handle, shrinks to 2^(12-N). That is, suppose if we send 4 bits of data in every trigger, the number of devices we can handle at the same time is, as small as 256.
One way to get around this problem, when we use N bits for data, is to keep the address bits the same, and send the actual data in chunks of N bits. Say for example, suppose we have to send the following stream of bits to a remote device,</p>

<p>1010 1010 1000 0101 1110</p>

<p>Say we have N = 4, the idea is to send it as follows. Please notice that the first 8 bits are the address of this particular device.</p>

<p>11101001 101011101001 101011101001 100011101001 010111101001 1110</p>

<p>This looks promising, but one question remains. How these chunks of data will be concatenated at the receiving end? So basically, it turns out that we need a Microcontroller for doing this. Well, then another question pops up, If we have a Microcontroller, then why should we use these limited 12-bit junk from Holtek?
This is exactly what I’m thinking right now. I have done some preliminary experiments with the 433Mhz modules and an Arduino here. Generally we can send square waves through these modules as it is. I have tried running the following simple sketch on it and I got the exact same signal on the other end,. It is worth noting that, there is some minor noise bursts observed in one receiver module’s output. No big deal, just a side note.

There is one more significant problem remaining here to be solved. When there is no signal available at the receiving end, the 433Mhz receiver produces garbage square wave. So, how do we find when to listen for the actual data and how it is interpreted? The simplest answer to this problem is that, We implement a protocol for it! Ok, we need a protocol to send the signal over to a device, so that it can identify actually when it receives a command and what exactly is the command it just received. I’m going through different serial protocols right now. I will surely pickup one of them, or in the worst case “invent” one of my own. Either way, I will post about it in the next article.
Stay alive!</p>
