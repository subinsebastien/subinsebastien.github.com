    <p>Reading Time : Less than 25 Minutes
Most of us develop PCBs for our hobby projects at home. Although, without following a proper process, chances are that you end up with a totally unusable result, or something that requires further hacks to make it working. This article contains some information I have acquired from my experiments in the PCB making process. Since making PCBs at home does not involve professional capabilities like proper chemical processing or machinery, it is quite difficult to obtain a proper output, compared to a commercial PCB manufacturer’s board.
Always start with the Simulation</p>

<p>A professional simulation software can give an overview about the expected output/working of any circuits. In my case I found, NI’s Multisim does not contain all the components I wanted, say for example, LM317 adjustable regulator was not found in the DB. Athough, it is quite good for doing basic stuff. Also, you can find custom parts on the internet, or even create parts on your own. A recent trend is with online simulators like CircuitLab or Digikey’s PartSim. But these solutions does not bundle a good database of electronic components.
Breadboard Prototypes
Preparing BOM from a breadboard is easier.
Trying the simulated circuit on a breadboard is always good. You are not wasting money on it, rather that cheap piece of plastic and metal could literally save a lot of time and it can produce better results once you complete your project. Breadboard prototype is also good that you can easily prepare bill of materials from it. While working with breadboards, try to get good quality jumper wires before starting to place components. Stripping and making jumpers in parallel with the circuit making could distract you. Buying shrink tubed jumper wires is a good investment, although, you can create jumpers from single core wires cut into equal lengths. Afterall, with breadboard prototypes, you can try equivalent parts in your circuit, in case if some parts in your project is unavailable in your local shops.
Eagle for Schematics and Layouts
Talking about Eagle is definitely enough for a future post, so I don’t really want to add more information about using Eagle here. Making schematics and PCB layout files is a bit tricky and difficult in Eagle to be honest. But, once the learning curve is covered up, it becomes a great tool to work with. Some general findings when using Eagle to avoid copper errors follows.
By default, Eagle uses narrow traces. When making PCBs at home, this is not very convenient. With methods like toner-transfer, narrow traces are more likely to be broken off. Increase the width to something like 0.0024 is good enough.
If you are using copper pour, make sure it is properly isolated from the other signals. Increase the isolation to something like 0.0012 is enough. When increasing isolation make sure the pour breaks apart.
Print the circuit multiple times on normal papers to check further for copper errors. Use the same paper to print again and again (ofcourse in different portions of the page) and you can easily compare among revisions.
When printing, use the black/monochrome option. Otherwise, you will be printing a lesser darker image on the paper. This is due to the fact that eagle uses lighter colors for pads and copper pours. Also, make sure the mirror option is unchecked. Your layout is already mirrored. :)
Do manual routing first. Place the components appropriately such that there are minimum number of jumpers and vias. Once components are placed correctly, do an autorouting. This will give an idea about where each traces can possible go. Once autorouted, manually separate traces from each other and pads. Change placing of components if required. Make sure each traces have enough room between them eventhough we end up with some minor copper errors while etching.
If using Eagle, print out the layout with all components inside the board area before starting the actual routing. Then compare the print with the actual component footprints. It is not easy to change package footprints once you complete routing. At this point, you could also inspect pad sizes and trace widths. If required, edit specific component package footprints and increase the pad size and shapes.
Better traces, good isolation and 10mil thermal separation to pads connected to the ground pour.
Afterall, it is not not necessary to use Eagle itself. There are better routing software like TopoR, which doesn’t insist trace shapes to be even, or programs like Ultiboard from NI works fine.</p>

<p>Toner Transfer
This is the only method I used so far. There are more professional methods like photo resistant clad board etching, but it is a bit more expensive and involves a bit more process. Probably, I will be doing it next week or so, and will post something about it as well. Toner is some chemical that requires very high temperatures to melt. With a photo paper, a laser printer can only make it hold on to the surface, and by using an iron box it is easy to transfer the toner to the copper clad board. You can see how to do the toner transfer here.
Chemical Etching
The chemical used in the etching process is expensive and not very easy to handle. Ferric Chloride cannot etch copper forever. In a 100ml solution, I was able to etch about 3 PCB with an average size of 3x4”. To reuse the same solution, you need to reduce the amount of copper etched off each time. That simply means, you need to use copper pours whenever it is possible. The lesser the exposed copper, the faster will be the etching.
An overly etched PCB along with a properly etched PCB. In the first case, the toner was not completely transferred to the copper, and thus some portion of the copper pour got etched by the solution. Although it looked ugly, it was still usable after a few hacks. The second PCB was etched after correcting some minor errors in the layout file.
It is preferred to use a high concentrated Ferric Chloride solution to etch off the unwanted copper from your board. From my experience, dipping the board in the solution for a very long time could rip off the toner as well. So use a concentrated, and if possible a preheated solution of ferric chloride for proper results. If the toner transfer was not proper, you might overly etch some portion of the circuit.
Hacking up Copper Errors
Even if we do all the necessary, it is quite possible to make errors. But in most cases, you can fix up the board by little hacks like using jumpers or cutting off some copper joints.
Multiple copper errors on a single PCB. Since the isolation is too low, copper pour is not completely etched off from the traces and it remains connected. The error inside the red circle is cut using a blade.
To cut off copper joints, use a sharp blade or something. You can hold the board against a light bulb and see if any unwanted connections remains. Use a DMM continuity check if required.
Happy Hacking… :)</p>
