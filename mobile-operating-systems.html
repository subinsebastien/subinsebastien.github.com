<p>Mobile phone operating systems are also known as mobile platforms. There are many mobile platforms are available as per the new market trends to had everything on mobile phones. Apart from texting or voice calling, mobile phones are turned out to be good Internet and multimedia devices. By the new breed devices in the market one can do anything on his/her mobile phone what he can do on his personal computer. The most popular mobile operating systems are namely</p>
<ul>
<li>Symbian</li>
<li>Windows Mobile</li>
<li>Android</li>
</ul>
<p>But by the market share in 2010, the major players are Symbian, Android, Apple iOS and RIM operating system. So lets have a brief description on this.</p>
<p><strong>Symbian OS</strong> The Symbian OS project was originally initiated by&#xA0;<a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.psionteklogix.com%2Fus&amp;t=NmM0ZWRmMDk0NGY2ZGNkMGUwZmNlNzg1NzFiMzFjMGU1YmZhZjA3YixkNmVzWHFYdg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ALX5p5KDoIXDXw2AOu5I9Ew&amp;m=1">Psion</a>&#xA0;in early 1990s for their SIBO devices. By that time it was simply known as EPOC<strong>.</strong>&#xA0;The first symbian OS smartphone was Nokia&#x2019;s 9210 communicator released in 2000 which was succeeded by Nokia&#x2019;s 9300 smartphone in 2005. These line of smartphones looked a lot like miniature laptops and had a good quality widescreen. Most of the controls provided by Symbian was sliding and locator (Read Logical Input Devices : Computer Graphics). The symbian version came with communicator was 6.0 and by theend of 2005 it turned 9.0.</p>

<p>Initial release for the user interface (The component which works in between the user and the OS) was named as&#xA0;<strong>Series 40</strong>&#xA0;and later on the new and enhanced&#xA0;<strong>Series 60&#xA0;</strong>has released. Series 40 came with 3x3 or a 3x4 menu grid and this model was then inherited by most of the mobile operating systems. Series 60 5th edition added up touch screen support which is then fired up the burst development of Samsung Omnia and Nokia N97 etc.</p>

<p>S40 series was capable of handling all sort of messaging types including SMS, MMS, EMS(<a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FEnhanced_Messaging_Service&amp;t=ZGEyNGYzNTMyZDBjYjdlMDU4MmFkMDc3MzkyNWU0ZjEyMWNkZjk0OSxkNmVzWHFYdg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ALX5p5KDoIXDXw2AOu5I9Ew&amp;m=1">Enhanced Messaging Service</a>) etc. S40 supported Internet services including web browsing and email. Apart from a phone or an Internet device, S40 made these devices, good MM enabled smartphones. A good music player, FM Radio support Video player and an Organiser were the new features introduced by S40 series. S40 series has an integrated WAP browser but it lacked ease of usage and thus most of the companies in the Symbian foundation bundled their mobile phones with a third party web browser called&#xA0;<strong>Opera Mini</strong>. It is far more intuitive and fits text better than the integrated browser. By the way network related features like Bluetooth, GPRS and EDGE were supported in Symbian OS. It even provided a functionality to use the mobile phone as a wireless modem that one can connect to his/her PC using a USB cable, for internet connectivity. Even though S40 become so popular, it lacked multitasking capabilities. This is because they aimed S40 for simpler devices with limited memory and smaller screen sizes.</p>
<p>S60 series was aimed to make these handheld devices to turn into a small laptop. Even though S40 supported Java applications (Java applications cannot exceed its heap memory more than 2MiB) it was unable to put applications in background. S60 completely supports multitasking. A taskbar similar to what we see in modern personal computers enabled fast user application switching. S60 introduced Wireless LAN (Wi-Fi), Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), and push mail support and protocols such as&#xA0;<a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FIMAP&amp;t=MGRmNzhhNTRhNjRmNmRlYmU4MThlNDg4OWQ4YjhlZTkwOWJkODgwMixkNmVzWHFYdg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ALX5p5KDoIXDXw2AOu5I9Ew&amp;m=1">IMAP</a>,&#xA0;<a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPOP3&amp;t=ODM4ZDgyNmU5YTZmMTc2ZmQ3ZWI4ZmRjMjlkYTVmODAyMDU5Njk1YyxkNmVzWHFYdg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ALX5p5KDoIXDXw2AOu5I9Ew&amp;m=1">POP3</a>,&#xA0;<a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSMTP&amp;t=NjMxNmRlYzljZGI1OTdlODkxOTNkMmUzMmU1OTZhZjA0ZjdjMDFjNCxkNmVzWHFYdg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ALX5p5KDoIXDXw2AOu5I9Ew&amp;m=1">SMTP</a>&#xA0;right out of the box. S60 provided much better web experience. It supported flash, Javascript etc natively. Also tabbed browsing is also introduced. I&#x2019;m not sure about the browser application<em>[citation needed]</em>.&#xA0;<a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nokia.co.in%2Ffind-products%2Fproducts%2Fnokia-5800-xpressmusic&amp;t=MTEyMGIxNzIwMzY4MDUzOGZjOTA1MzA0NzQ1MjViNzkzYTYxNWM5NixkNmVzWHFYdg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ALX5p5KDoIXDXw2AOu5I9Ew&amp;m=1">Nokia&#x2019;s 5800</a>&#xA0;is an example for Symbian OS devices with S60 platform.</p>
<p><strong>Windows Mobile</strong> Microsoft started towards the development of complete operating systems that can fit into handheld devices which are known to be minimal in resources. They started with the WindowsCE operating system which is adopted by many companies for their handhelds like PDA&#x2019;s. The first release was in 1996. WindowsCE is optimized for devices that have minimal storage. Windows Mobile and WindowsCE are entirely different projects. They are related to each other because they belongs to a single operating system family. Windows Mobile is partially evolved from WindowsCE. WindowsCE can run on wide veriety of non-mobile phone devices like ticketing machine, kiosks, PDAs, and some handheld PCs. Windows Mobile is decorated with mobile phone stuff around the WindowsCE platform.</p>

<p>The Windows desktop operating system is one of the most popular software around the globe. So Windows Mobile has been accepted very quickly among the users. Microsoft had an eye on keeping the same software that the users familiar with on their personal computer to be ported cleanly to the Windows Mobile platform. So most of the users think that the device they are handling are miniature personal computers. And additionally the mobile phone stuff, like messaging, voice calling improved the capabilities. With the release of the latest Windows desktop operating system, the Windows 7, Windows Mobile also had a stunning look and feel.</p>
