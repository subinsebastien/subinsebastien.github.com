          <p>Everybody kind of forgot about the best Android phone ever to be produced, the <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_nexus_i9250-4219.php">Galaxy Nexus</a>, after Google abandoned it with Android 4.4 OTA update. There will not be another update from Google for Galaxy Nexus in the future due to some driver portability issues for its TI OMAP core. But recently someone from the community managed to build AOSP Android 5.0 for Galaxy Nexus bringing it back from the grave. I was kind of happy to see this as I’m still a proud owner of one of them, and didn’t have a budget to spend on new gadgets every other week. So, I decided to flash my Nexus with Lollipop and this is just a brief post about it. The following steps just worked for me pretty well.</p>

          <p>Reading time : Less than 20 minutesSuppose you own a web domain, the first thing you ought to do is that to setup a website for it. The second thing is highly probably, setting up an e-mail system. By an e-mail system, what I mean is a complete system that typically has the following capabilities.Send &amp; Receive emailsRead and create emailsDelete emails
Filter unwanted emails
Create/Delete email accounts
When you want to do all these, your first choice is to look for providers such as Google Apps, Outlook.com, Freemail, Zoho etc. Some of them provide free pricing plans and upto 10 email addresses in their free tier. All of them include webmail capability, so you do not need an email client on your local machine. Mails can be managed from a web application provided by them. Without a doubt, Google is the best among these providers and they have an awesome webmail interface similar to Gmail. An year ago, they have removed the free plan, and my next option was Outlook.com since their service appeared to be almost in par with Google’s and slightly better than Zoho’s. And, now that they have removed their free service as well, I need to switch to another. Now, most of the times, you might not be able to retain your old e-mails unless you back up everything regularly. Often this is not the case, and I cannot afford another move. So, I decided to setup an email server on my own as I write this article down. My plan is to document each step as I do it, so you can follow this to setup yours as well.Step Zero - Prepare a Server (Optional if you have one already)If you have a static public IP and a decent server machine, you are good to skip this step. In my case I didn’t have one, and I built one on Amazon EC2. Basically it is a virtual server, having all the capabilities of a normal server. I can access the machine using SSH from my local machine. Setting up an EC2 instance is very easy, and I chose to run Ubuntu 14.04-amd64 server edition on my server instance. Its basically a t2-micro type instance and it is free of cost for upto 750 hours of usage per month. I’m not quite sure about its running expense for a long term use, since I’m using one for the firs time. Down the line I will try to update this article when I start getting my invoices from Amazon.You must also have an MX record in your domain’s DNS zone file pointing to your designated mail server. Open your domain setting and find the DNS zone settings. Then remove all the MX records there and fill the following data.Host : Leave it blank or input @ Mail Server Name : your_mail_server.yourdomain.comPriority : 10TTL : Lowest valueThis will take s a few minutes to propagate. So you can proceed to the next step and you can check if the servers has picked up your new MX by the following command from your local machine.dig mx yourdomain.comStep One - Install Postfix SMTP ServerA mail systems is indeed a composition of a couple of tools. The following list includes the most basic componentsAn SMTP server
IMAP / POP3 server
Authentication System such as SASL (Optional)
Webmail (Optional)
The SMTP server is the core of an e-mail system. It provides the basic capabilities of sending and receiving mails based on a protocol called Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). There are many SMTP server solutions ranging from the simplistic OpenSMTPD to Haraka a super fast node.js SMTP server. We are going to use the Postfix SMTP server for this article. Postfix is free and open source. To install postfix, execute the following command on your Ubuntu server.sudo apt-get install postfixYou will be presented with two questions typically. For the first question General type of mail Configuration select Internet Site. The second question will be to set a System mail name. Input your domain name there, say for example mydomain.com, and you are good to go. If any other questions are asked, leave them out with default configurations.Step Two - Create a User AccountThis unix user will be the owner of the virtual mailbox. The reason why we have virtual mailboxes is that, we cannot create new unix accounts our server every time a new email address is required. So all mail addresses will be having their inboxes in this one single virtual mailbox.sudo groupadd -g 5000 vmailsudo useradd -m -u 5000 -g 5000 -s /bin/bash vmailStep Three - Configure Mail DomainsWe have to define for which domains this email server is going to be setup. So that it can receive mails designated for those domains. In my case it is just for one domain. sudo touch /etc/postfix/vhostssudo echo yourdomain.com &gt; /etc/postfix/vhostsStep Four - Assign mail foldersNow create file that describes which folders we are going to use for storing emails for each mail addresses. Each mail address should have one specific directory and you can point multiple addresses to a single inbox if required. Execute the following commandsudo vim /etc/postfix/vmapsand input your mail addresses and corresponding mail directories. My vmaps file looks like the following.subin@mydomain.com     mydomain.com/subinnapster@mydomain.com  mydomain.com/subinsales@mydomain.com      mydomain.com/salesWe need to hash this file to be used by the postfix system. If in the future, this file is edited for including more email maps, be sure to run the following command then as well.sudo postmap /etc/postfix/vmapsStep Five - Configure PostfixNow from the useradd command, default home folders will be created by the system as /home/vmail. This folder is going to be our virtual mailbox base directory. Now open /etc/postfix/main.cf and add the following lines to it.home_mailbox = Maildir/virtual_mailbox_domains = /etc/postfix/vhostsvirtual_mailbox_base = /home/vmailvirtual_mailbox_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/vmapsvirtual_minimum_uid = 1000virtual_uid_maps = static:5000virtual_gid_maps = static:5000More that the uid and gid should match what we used in step two.Step Six - Test your Mail serverRestart the postfix service and try out a test mail inwards and outwards. Make sure the MX record is now up and pointing to this server. use the following command to send a test mail from this machine.sendmail somemail@gmail.comfrom: sales@yourdomain.comHello, this is a test mail.The dot[.] at the end tells the sendmail command that you are done with the email body. Now somemail@gmail.com will have one mail in its inbox. Now try sending a mail back to sales@yourdomain.com and which will be present in the following directory after a few minutes. /home/vmail/yourcomain.com/sales/new If any of these two does not work properly, you missed some steps in between, or the configuration is incorrect. Now you have a fully functional email server ready to send and receive mails from and to any networks. But this setup is a very minal one if you are planning to use it for your professional requirements. In that case you also need another layer called Mail Access Layer. So that you can read/write and send/receive mails in a lot more efficient way. I will covering up this in the next article.</p>

Problem Statement
Calculate the filter coefficients for a low-pass FIR filter with cut-off frequency 1000Hz where the sampling frequency is 5Khz. Consider the filter passband gain as unity, and the impulse response sequence length is 7. Use a Hamming window to remove spectral leakage.</p>

This is more or less a learning stage article. I’m learning iOS these days, and as usual I find it challenging. I’m not a very noteworthy developer anyway, but still the learning curve is not so steep. You need the right tools and right amount of passion for learning iOS development. Ofcourse you need a Mac, and XCode running to develop apps for the iOS or the OS-X platform. Check my other iOS article for environment setup.
What we are building?
We are building a very simple weather search application. You may search with a city name, and the app will show you the latest weather information provided by the awesome Open Weather Map API. Openweathermap is free to use for non-commercial purpose. Their API has JSON support, means we can retrieve data from their systems as JSON Object that typically looks something like the following. Please note that JSON is not particularly useful, unless we parse it to an NSDictionary or a NSArray.
https://gist.github.com/subinsebastien/e663825d2624359b9aef
Our app will let the user enter a city name and press a search button that triggers the network query. The GUI is simple, you will just need a Text Field, a Button and a Text View that fills the rest of the area on the screen. The text field will be used to display the result. Dealing with storyboard is easier in XCode’s Assistance View. Connect the Outlets and Action and you are done. Once correctly done, your XXViewController.h will look like the following.
https://gist.github.com/subinsebastien/8802a3e0f42956ffd28b
Now it is the time for implementation. What we basically do is, create a NSURLConnection and make an asynchronous request with it. Once the response is received, which is by the way a JSON object, parse it to an NSDictionary. NSDictionary is further useful if you want to get the value of a particular key in the JSON or for doing such things. The implementation is as follows.
https://gist.github.com/subinsebastien/3b160b4192dd15179b29
The result is just awesome! You enter a city name, and what you get is the complete response displayed in the textview. It is not the world’s most attractive UI, but it is simple and easy get started with. Take a look.</p>

It has been more than a week since the Malaysian Airline Flight-370 has been missing after its successful take off from a Malaysian airport. I have been closely researching on the topic since it came as a shocking news to me as well as I was amazed how modern technology is limited when it comes to situations like these. The aircraft was a passenger jet boarded with 239 people including crew and pilots, and it was an ER series (stands for Extended Range) Boeing 777 which is usually used in 9/11 kind of attacks. I live in India and one US diplomat speculated that the same flight could have been hijacked to execute an attack similar to 9/11 in an Indian city. I’m trying to analyse as much information as available to see what could have happened to the air plane and a set of events happened in the past 10 days.</p>

          <span class="meta">
            14 Nov 2013
          </span>
          <p>Reading time : Less than 30 minutesIts been a while I was thinking to post an article about broadcast receivers. I have done a number of projects which makes extensive use of broadcast receivers. There are a number of use cases where broadcast receivers are highly usable as well. Lets see how broadcast receivers can be made use of in Android. In layman terms, broadcasts are like a message that is sent across the entire system. Anyone with the appropriate address and permission can read the broadcast-ed message. For the sake of simplicity, I’m dropping out the concept of permissions. Basically you can catch broadcasts using a Broadcast Receiver with correct address or action as called by Android guys :). The word address in the context of broadcast receivers refers to an Intent Filter, by means of which, anyone can receive broadcasts that comes under that filter. Lets start with Intent Filters. Intent Filters can be defined in your Android application in two ways.
In your Java files through android.content.IntentFilter class
In your manifest file, using the <intent-filter> tag
Note, that you cannot typically use an Intent Filter defined in the manifest through any Java files or vice versa. Or atleast I don’t know if that is possible. Anyway, it is safe to say that, you can use Intent filters defined in your java files to create broadcast receivers that has an Activity scope, and you can use manifest based filters to create receivers that has the Application context. So it turns out that, you can create two types of broadcast receivers.
Broadcast receivers with application context.
Broadcast receivers with Activity context.
To enable a broadcast receiver, you need to register it per se. As explained above, you can register it for the entire application by registering it through the manifest file, or you can register it inside any activities you need to receive broadcasts. Before going into depths of the same, lets see how to send a simple broadcast.
https://gist.github.com/subinsebastien/7462040
Ok, there is a hell lot of variants for the broadcast sending function. For now, lets check out the simplest one, that is sendBroadcast(Intent intent). This method takes an intent as the parameter. Lets see how this can used in a typical condition.
https://gist.github.com/subinsebastien/7462190
This is simple huh? It sends a simple broadcast with an action string ACTION_HELLO as the so called address. This simply means that, any broadcast receiver with intent filter set to ACTION_HELLO can receive this broadcast. Lets create such a broadcast receiver.
https://gist.github.com/subinsebastien/7462046
Ok, it still doesn’t says what intent filter this receive is planning to use. So we have to enable or register this broadcast receiver to do that. As we have seen earlier, we can register it for the entire application or we can register it for just one activity. For registering it for the entire application, you need to add the corresponding entry into the manifest, inside the <application> tag.
https://gist.github.com/subinsebastien/7462053
And for doing the same inside an activity, you can do it simply as follows. Remember, this particular receiver will work only if the activity is visible and it cannot receive any broadcasts if the activity is not in the foreground.
https://gist.github.com/subinsebastien/7462068
Ok, this part needs a little bit of explanation. We may simply register this receiver in the onCreate() itself. But in that case, there is a risk of leaking memory if the activity is killed or has moved to the background. To avoid this, I register the receiver inside the onResume() and safely unregister the same from inside the onPause(). As you might know, onPause() will be triggered when the activity is about to go to the background. A complete sample project is available here for downloading and testing out broadcast receivers.</application></intent-filter></p>

Holtek produces a number of encoders and decoders to be used in minimal remote control applications. I’m about to work on a project that involves some basic RF remote control circuit. As the preliminary research starts, I came across an RF transmitter module which does not support direct serial data transmission. We have to use encoders like the HT12E for giving proper input to the module. The RF transmitter I have just uses 433Mhz ASK. For it, to be used as a remote control, we need to encode our parallel data into serial burst data. HT12E just got my attention because it was known to me long before. With an oscilloscope here, I wired up and tested the following circuit.</p>

More and more modern day consumer electronic devices are becoming wireless. Say for example, keyboards, mouses, printers, car-locks, point of sale equipment or almost anything that you can think of. I came across working on a POS application for Android which requires a mobile phone to talk to a ESC/POS  printer over Bluetooth. The Android Bluetooth stack requires both the parties in the communication, to be bonded (paired up) before starting to send data over the Bluetooth. Also, the new version of Android (4.1x) includes significant changes in the Bluetooth stack which makes the communication even restricted/secure.
Communicating with an embedded device is somewhat different from communicating with a regular Bluetooth enabled telephony device. First of all, an embedded device might not have a keypad or a screen to indicate what is going on. We are either on a pure-guess-side or we should be correctly following the manufacturer datasheets. In my case I was dealing with AB-330M Mobile POS printer which follows the Epson ESC protocol. It just had two button on the front panel and not any other feature except an LED to blink in case of occurrence of an error.</p>

Most of us develop PCBs for our hobby projects at home. Although, without following a proper process, chances are that you end up with a totally unusable result, or something that requires further hacks to make it working. This article contains some information I have acquired from my experiments in the PCB making process. Since making PCBs at home does not involve professional capabilities like proper chemical processing or machinery, it is quite difficult to obtain a proper output, compared to a commercial PCB manufacturer’s board.
Always start with the Simulation</p>

The function generator IC XR2206 from EXAR corporation is pretty popular among hobbyists. Although, it is popular, the company stopped the production of this IC earlier in 2011. Yet, it is available in some local shops and of course on ebay. I have a few here in my home workshop, and I worked with one of them today to develop a small function generator for my personal use. The application circuit from the datasheet worked just fine. </p>

I was trying to remotely maneuver a prototype robot I have made last week. If you happen to read it, you might know about it. I had an infrared receiver named TSOP1738 and a few different remote controls left useless from a car audio system and a TV here. I had IR LEDs as well, but to avoid unnecessary complexity I chose to use one of the remote controls over building one on my own with the LEDs. Here is a study I have made to make this thing work as I expected.</p>

Well, it could be fairly easy for geeks, but not for kids who starts to learn electronics. I have been looking around for a solution for driving DC motors with Arduino, eventhough I’m not a kid. I’m 24 by the way, and I’m not married! Ok, anyway I found out a number of motor driving setups either using dual H-Bridge ICs like L298 or L293D. They are still ofcourse elegant solutions if you want to drive just 1 or 2 motors using your Arduino. It gives you full control, so that you can drive the motor in either CW or CCW direction. The problem with this solution is that, you have to sacrifice a number of digital lines to work with these ICs. As you all know, most Arduinos have few number of pins to work with. Mine is Duemilanove, which has just 14 I/O pins. So this should be considered when you need to do something else with your remaining pins while the others driving motors.
In the Arduino book, there was another solution using a MOSFET or something which I don’t clearly remember. So I can’t comment about that right now. On the other hand, here I have another solution which I found on a website. They showed, how to drive a power LED with PWM using an IC named ULN2003A. ULN200X are generally darlington pair arrays. So what is a darlington pair?</p>

          <p>This part is some junk story, so you may skip
First of all, this is something that happened to me and, it is just a post about how I recovered myself from the mess. You are gonna slap me if I tell you how idiotic I was to loose all my data anyway. I was updating my Linux Mint 14 laptop with Linux Mint 15 RC, which has been released yesterday by a fresh reinstall. As usual I backed up all my files in the /home/napster folder, which is nothing but my home folder, to another spare PC here and since all of my critical documents are on Dropbox and Google Drive, that part was pretty safe. Before starting gone-deadly installation, my TOSHIBA-250GB HDD looked something like the following.The partition labelled Data was the central place where I kept all my stuff like movies, music, photos and e-books and everything as such. And this drive was 200GB in size, and it was around 99% occupied. As you see this is a pretty deadly combination that, if you accidentally lose the data, there is not much space left to stand up and do the recovery from within the disc. Anyway, this is what I did in the apocalyptic re-installation. First I booted the machine with a Linux Mint 15 RC CD-ROM and while the installation process, I have chosen Replace Linux Mint 14 with Linux Mint 15. This was somewhat a very bad thing to do, although I didn’t expect all my partitions will be lost. After the installation, I have immediately noticed that all my partitions and data are lost, forever. This is somewhat the HDD looked like after the re-installation.I was stupid enough to use the new installation for a few more minutes and install a few applications like Chrome Browser or the VLC player. Then I realized that the situation is real worse. With each apps being used, and with each app being newly installed, I’m technically overwriting one file or the other in my old partitions. I have stopped immediately, turned off the PC and looked around for solutions. I was pretty panicked and didn’t know what to do. I have headed to some IRC chat rooms and most of them were pretty sure that, I’m never going to get those data back.I paused for a while and the next thing to do was to audit the damages. I have thoroughly tried to recall what files did I have on the machine before loosing the partitions. I have listed all those I could recall and analyzed which of them are potentially high priority files and which of them I could afford to loose. That opened little bit of a room to settle down for a while. Because most of the files where not that critical and to be honest, almost with any of them, I could live in the absence of them. So by the evening I decided not to approach any professional companies to do this recovery process, and assigned myself to give it a try.
Boring Story is over, You may read from here on.
For the sake of safety, I have gathered a 500GB external HDD. I thought I could use it in case if I need to profile the entire hard disk to an image. The most important tool to use was testdisk. This is an elegantly written open source software, which is the only tool I used in the entire process of the recovery. I have found a lot of threads discussing data loss due to the same incorrect Linux installation attempts. But none of them lead me to a proper recovery solution. Most threads where flooded by commercial data recovery companies and their sucky ads. So, I have found testdisk on the Ubuntu’s data recovery guide. But it was not at all documented there. I have setup a virtual machine quickly to get myself familiar with the interface of the testdisk tool. It is infact a 100% command line tool, with menu like interface much similar to what is provided by parted or such tools. I don’t know why I choose testdisk since the other two tools (one was gparted - I knew it was of no use) were documented there properly. Anyway I headed to the testdisk wiki and learned how to do the Deep Search process for the lost partitions and how to write the partition table back to the disk itself. The following were the major steps in the process.
Boot the machine from a Live CD. I used Linux Mint 15 RC CD-ROM itself, since it was already available, as you would guess. Please note that the entire system is in the RAM when booting live, so the recovery process depends on the available RAM you do have. If possible, extend the RAM before initiating the recovery, or move the HDD to another PC with faster/larger RAM, although I’m not sure the later one is a good idea.
Install the testdisk application. Please note that the installation goes to the RAM as well. So its better not to run any other apps from this Live CD for the sake of speed. Now, run the tool</p>

In this post, I thought I would share a few utility functions for Android Developers. These are indeed used by me in different projects. My plan is to keep updating this post as new utility functions are found across. Please note that, not all the code is mine, but I borrowed from different people around the globe. So credits goes to them as well. So far the list of functions includes the following.
Check if the phone is connected to the Internet
Get EXIF rotation information of an Image
Get a view object from a layout id
Convert pixels to dp (dip)
Create a file object with correct media type, and handle name conflicts.
Get the width of the screen in pixels
Get a scaled bitmap from another
NB : The description about the function is followed by code snippets for each.
ConnectivityLets begin with the connectivity check function. The function uses the Connectivity Manager class to check whether the phone is connected or not. Please do keep in mind that it does not really checks out about Internet connectivity, but it just checks if the phone connected to a WiFi or your mobile data network. For finding if the Internet connection is working or not, you really have to make a network request from the phone.

          <p>Its been just a day or two since Ubuntu Phone OS’s preview has been released. Along with a lot others, I installed it on my phone and it works pretty well. You can find the whole documentation on how to install it on your device here. After a few hours of fiddling with the OS, I thought it will be a good idea to develop some quick apps for the phone. As such there is no official guides to develop your hello world apps for the phone at the moment, although the resource available on the Ubuntu site is just enough to pull out some idea and develop a test app for it. In this post, I present you a quick guide to develop a simple XKCD comic app for Ubuntu Phone OS. The expected features are listed below. You can add more features as you learn more.
Have a title bar and show XKCD on it
A button named Random
On clicking Random it should load a random comic from xkcd.
The features are simple enough for a hello world app. So first thing to consider is the API xkcd provides. Thankfully the xkcd API is also very simple to be used in our app. The xkcd API returns JSON document from which we get comic metadata such as image URL and comic search keyword strings. So that part is more or less fine. You can see the API details here.As with any projects, the next step is to create a mockup for the application. I use pencil here to create a mockup as shown in the image below.</p>

You might like this post post if you are a screwed developer just like me. I’ve heard that necessity is the mother of invention. I didn’t believe it till yesterday. The situation I’m going to tell you might probably familiar for many of us here. In some applications there are some places where you must restrict the number of instances of a class to just one. Yeah only one! For example the application class. You cannot make more than one instance of an application class in a single application. Another example will be logger classes. For one application, there should also be one and only one instance of this class also.
In my case, I’ve wrote a database handler for my application which takes care of the low level db stuff with some abstraction. It just had few methods including putData() and getData(). The process of adding database to my application and database credential configuration were done inside the default constructor of this class. Which seemed absolutely useful in my application. I thought I can make an object of this handler class where ever I wanted and put and get data from the database.
The problem occurred when I started creating objects of this handler class. When ever I create a new object, the constructor got called. Which added one database for each object, and which showed me an error that duplication database connections exists in my application. I was not able to go ahead with duplicate databases. So, I looked around, done a lot of Googling, asked a couple of developer friends across the world, and concluded that there are three solutions for this problem.
Create a single global object of the handler class and access it from where ever I want
Move the database adding process out of the constructor which avoids multiple calls
Make the handler class Singleton, so that no more than one instance could exists at any time
At first creating a global object looked easier for me. I thought I could just make a global instance in a globals header where I handle other global stuffs, and it just didn’t work. I tried accessing it in other files where it is required using the extern keyword, but it seemed like it was not my day. As I shared I couldn’t make it work, some friends suggested making it singleton. I couldn’t even think of moving the database adding process out of the constructor, which will break the soul purpose of that class. Also, I was not sure where to do it, if not inside the constructor. Also, if I do so, I might run into further bugs and it will be terrific for me track the outcomes later on. So, I decided to use singleton pattern which was widely recognized as complex but right among developers. And finally I made it work. So, apart from the story here is a simple example for singleton classes in C++. I used Qt for developing this application, but the concept is applicable to most of the object oriented languages.
First open Qt-Creator and create a new Qt console project. You will get a skeleton application. Now add a new class to this project. For this, right click on the project folder and select Add New.</p>

For most of the advanced users, these two terms will be much familiar. So, this article is for new developers. Most of the today’s desktop programming toolkits are object oriented. Lets take an example of popular X-Window GUI toolkits like GTK+ or Qt, both are object oriented. GTK+ is written in C, and the object-orientation in GTK+ is achieved by using the GLib object system, whereas Qt is written in C++ and is purely object oriented. The main, advantage of object oriented design in widget toolkits is that, they can model entities like windows, widgets, or features etc as objects. By definition as objects should have three properties,
Identity, which makes an object unique
Attributes, which specifies the state of an object
Methods, which defines the behaviour of an object
It is very easier for the toolkit developer to make an exact analogy with a GUI elements like a window or a widget in object oriented programming. Even though it makes the life of the toolkit developers job a bit happier, on the other side, application developers face a minute problem. I’m not sure if I could say it is a problem, but still there is something I would like to point out as an application developer, who extensively uses toolkits. A completely object oriented toolkit always provides a property based API, which means, to do something with an element inside it, we have to do the following steps.
Create an object of that element
Set required properties to that object to change its state like we do
Call one of the methods to get the functionality from the object
It may look simpler to some new programmers since they play with pretty simple tasks most. When it gets a little bit complex, say if you are developing a complex application, you cannot spend that much time to do a simple task in between the actual coding. For example, if you are developing a big ERP system, you cannot always spend much time to show different kind of message boxes in between for different purposes. That will increase the number of lines of code in your application and you get messed up with the logic of the application as a whole.
One of the easy way to manage this is, to create a simple function which can take a number of parameters/arguments, call the required method and finally return a useful value to the developer. In case of a message box, it can take the message text, names of buttons to be shown and finally can return which button the user have clicked on. So, apparently we can tweak the three step process into a one step process, which is just a function call. But this has a scalability issue when the message boxes requires completely different kind of apparances in different occurrences - eventually we will keep on developing our custom function to handle all of the cases, which again causes problems. But, the developers life gets much more happier if the toolkit itself contains those kind of functions! Here comes the concept of Static Functions API. Most of the today’s toolkits has both of these APIs so that developers can use them appropriately according as the situation. A good example I’ve seen is : the Qt Message Box API itself. So that’s all, and I hope, when you look into documentations you will keep this post in mind to choose stuff a little more wisely.

          <p>Most of the real world applications use databases to store data in a structured manner. Databases provide a very programmatic way to store and retrieve organised data. Qt, just like any other professional toolkit, provides rich set of database drivers and libraries to handle database functionality in a very managed way. It this, post, I would like to show you a simple example of how to use database with Qt. To begin with, create a console qt application and name it, say DBApp. Then add a reference to the project(.pro) file that we are going to use database in this project.</p>

In this article I’m trying to introduce you a simple microcontroller board. There is nothing surprising for those people who are using Arduino already, since I just use an example program which is bundled with the Arduino software. So, only those noobs can come along, and others, please google some other interesting articles. By the way, you can go and get started with Arduino stuff from here. There are a number of Arduino boards are available in the market and there are a couple of clones are also available. I’m using the one called Duemilanove which is a property of Emdesic. The board’s name is pretty easy to pronounce, huh? Take a look at it.</p>

I would like to introduce you guys into another fruitful environment in application development. Apart from the mobile applications, we should think seriously about desktop application development also. So far, I have been using GTK+ and glade for creating simple applications. But it is for the first time I’m using Qt for doing the same. I feel farthermost advanced in creating useful applications. So, this time I’ll be posting something much more mature than a Hello World application. It would be a converter application, which will be capable of converting currencies and length among different units. So, lets begin with Qt Creator. Qt is a carefully designed application development framework. We will be get into an environment where we will get everything we would be expecting. Anyway, for a simple converter application, we don’t have to learn Qt very deeply. Lets begin with creating an empty project in Qt Creator.
Open Qt Creator -&gt; File -&gt; New File or Project -&gt; Other Project -&gt; Empty Qt Project and click Choose</p>

As I was going through my daily routines, I just came across a simple issue. I’ve a Linux machine and it has about 20 to 30 users who uses ssh to connect to the machine. I’m the root user and none of the other users have root privileges. I want to restrict the users from running nmap (a tool used for scanning networked machines) during a period of time. The conditions are as follows.
At 6HRS all instances of the tool should be killed
After 6HRS no users should be able to run the tool
After 20HRS, everyone can start using the tool, no issue :)
But make sure it wont continue after 6HRS next day!
So, here is a simple script that can do the same. I used pkill for killing processes, so that I can avoid having the logic of finding instances and killing them. To reduce resource utilisation I used a sleep command in between(?). Take a look at the script.</p>

In many applications I had run into situations where I can’t predetermine the number of arguments while defining a function. Or even, some of you might be wondering how the printf() function works  fine any number of arguments if proper format string is provided. Suppose If I have to get the maximum value out of a number of variables, see If don’t know the number of variables to be handled, it will be a mess. We would rather use an array, but that is not a good idea when you really want to reflect the idea of handling multiple values in a function signature. It would be better if we can call the same function as either,</p>

Another programming puzzle on these days is to check whether two strings are anagrams or not. As per the definition from Wikipedia, anagrams are strings with
Same number of characters apart from white spaces
The letters will be scrambled across the string
Intersection of both character set will be equal to the set itself
Err… for better English you can read something like this. Anyway, I think you got the overall idea, that is the strings  William Shakespeare and I am a weakish speller are anagrams. Now, lets figure out how can we hack the problem. Lets start writing a Phrase class.</p>

As a part of an interview, the interviewer asked me to implement a circular linked list. The basic concept is nothing but all the nodes in the list should be connected to the one before it and to the one next to it. Also, it should be circular, the tail should refer the head and the head should refer the tail. Ah, well since it is circular, we can say, just a referring pointer rather than head or tail, which looks more apt.</p>

For those who reads this article just to hack and spoof a mail to irritate other people, can leave right now. I don’t believe you can do it effectively before knowing what you are about to do! And also, it might possibly be illegal if other people are involved. SMTP servers are used to send mails across the Internet. They are also known as mail servers. The job of a mail server is nothing but to store and send emails as well as receive emails from other mail servers. It is possible to send emails from one user who belongs to a mail server to a user belongs to a different mail server.
So, lets find a mail server somewhere on the Internet. Before going into details, there is one more thing to mention about - ports. Ports are logical entities through which hosts and servers communicate. There are 65355 ports each for TCP and UDP. So, one could possibly say a port runs an application interface. Since many applications keep using the same ports for years, those port they use are known for running the particular application. For example, port 80 is very popular which normally runs HTTP. It doesn’t mean that HTTP can’t run on 45627 or another application can’t run on 80 either.
SMTP is a simple protocol or standard which can handle electronic mail over the Internet. You can find more details about SMTP here. SMTP runs on port number 25. So, our target is some machine which has port 25 open. There is a very useful tool named nmap. Nmap is nothing but a stealth  capable scanner which can fingerprint machines and services running on  them. You can a copy of nmap from here. I suggest you to use the command line version, since it is more flexible in my experience. And also it is good practice to use command line tools. This is because, when you break into others machines, they are never gonna provide you a very good user friendly GUI to mess their system up. Its worth noting that, running nmap on other’s machines without permission is illegal.
Finding other machines over the Internet is not a big deal. When you get an IP you can use nmap for checking if SMTP port is open or not. Use the following command for doing this. Since some hosts/firewalls blocks ping probs, we can use SYN scan.</p>

The first thing to do was to Google around a little on this. Just because I was using Internet from my campus, the messy proxy server refused to go to many links returned be Google. Pretty bad, no?

Just as I mentioned in the last post, gidentify project has given me another work around. My plan was to pipe the output of the command line tool identify to the graphical user interface. I was using GTK+ and the available option for this was to use GtkTextView widget which can be used to display mutiline text. Unlike GtkEntry, which could only display a single line text at a time, GtkTextView seemed to be flexible. GtkLabel was another possibility, but it lacked user functionality like Editing. By the way my plan was to display the output of the command on the GUI, and I thought the system function will be just enough. When I manned system(), it has given me a sad news that the system() function would just return the exit status of the command passed to system() as the argument. I searched for an API for this purpose but I was unable to find one. So I figured out a code like this,</p>

But by the market share in 2010, the major players are Symbian, Android, Apple iOS and RIM operating system. So lets have a brief description on this.
Symbian OSThe Symbian OS project was originally initiated by Psion in early 1990s for their SIBO devices. By that time it was simply known as EPOC. The first symbian OS smartphone was Nokia’s 9210 communicator released in 2000 which was succeeded by Nokia’s 9300 smartphone in 2005. These line of smartphones looked a lot like miniature laptops and had a good quality widescreen. Most of the controls provided by Symbian was sliding and locator (Read Logical Input Devices : Computer Graphics). The symbian version came with communicator was 6.0 and by theend of 2005 it turned 9.0.
S40 series Mobile Platform
Initial release for the user interface (The component which works in between the user and the OS) was named as Series 40 and later on the new and enhanced Series 60 has released. Series 40 came with 3x3 or a 3x4 menu grid and this model was then inherited by most of the mobile operating systems. Series 60 5th edition added up touch screen support which is then fired up the burst development of Samsung Omnia and Nokia N97 etc.

S40 series was capable of handling all sort of messaging types including SMS, MMS, EMS(Enhanced Messaging Service) etc. S40 supported Internet services including web browsing and email. Apart from a phone or an Internet device, S40 made these devices, good MM enabled smartphones. A good music player, FM Radio support Video player and an Organiser were the new features introduced by S40 series. S40 series has an integrated WAP browser but it lacked ease of usage and thus most of the companies in the Symbian foundation bundled their mobile phones with a third party web browser called Opera Mini. It is far more intuitive and fits text better than the integrated browser. By the way network related features like Bluetooth, GPRS and EDGE were supported in Symbian OS. It even provided a functionality to use the mobile phone as a wireless modem that one can connect to his/her PC using a USB cable, for internet connectivity. Even though S40 become so popular, it lacked multitasking capabilities. This is because they aimed S40 for simpler devices with limited memory and smaller screen sizes.
S60 series was aimed to make these handheld devices to turn into a small laptop. Even though S40 supported Java applications (Java applications cannot exceed its heap memory more than 2MiB) it was unable to put applications in background. S60 completely supports multitasking. A taskbar similar to what we see in modern personal computers enabled fast user application switching. S60 introduced Wireless LAN (Wi-Fi), Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), and push mail support and protocols such as IMAP, POP3, SMTP right out of the box. S60 provided much better web experience. It supported flash, Javascript etc natively. Also tabbed browsing is also introduced. I’m not sure about the browser application[citation needed]. Nokia’s 5800 is an example for Symbian OS devices with S60 platform.
Windows MobileMicrosoft started towards the development of complete operating systems that can fit into handheld devices which are known to be minimal in resources. They started with the WindowsCE operating system which is adopted by many companies for their handhelds like PDA’s. The first release was in 1996. WindowsCE is optimized for devices that have minimal storage. Windows Mobile and WindowsCE are entirely different projects. They are related to each other because they belongs to a single operating system family. Windows Mobile is partially evolved from WindowsCE. WindowsCE can run on wide veriety of non-mobile phone devices like ticketing machine, kiosks, PDAs, and some handheld PCs. Windows Mobile is decorated with mobile phone stuff around the WindowsCE platform.

Windows Mobile was released in 2000. And by the release of each desktop Windows release, Microsoft repainted the Windows Mobile. By the end of 2003, the Windows Mobile become so popular among the mobile phone operating systems.

The Windows desktop operating system is one of the most popular software around the globe. So Windows Mobile has been accepted very quickly among the users. Microsoft had an eye on keeping the same software that the users familiar with on their personal computer to be ported cleanly to the Windows Mobile platform. So most of the users think that the device they are handling are miniature personal computers. And additionally the mobile phone stuff, like messaging, voice calling improved the capabilities. With the release of the latest Windows desktop operating system, the Windows 7, Windows Mobile also had a stunning look and feel.

When I was in high school or something, I had an inclination to small and new breed devices of that time. I was so amazed by the computer technologies that I had day dreamed about some miniature computing devices which I can afford and put in my pocket safely. I was unaware of the device that I seen on some note book cover or so was not a computer but a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant). I was using Microsoft Windows ‘98 at that time in my school. So I wondered when I see the Start button on the screen of that device. I thought that it was a mini-computer that is capable of performing all the necessary computing that I need. It was just Paint or Notepad what I refer to ‘‘computing’ at that time. One of them was later on identified as iPAQ from Compaq computers.

When I was able to do a search (it was yahoo if I remember correctly) I had figured out that there are more devices out in the market that I can dream about. At that point HP hired Compaq or what ever, iPAQ was owned by HP and I continued to love the device.

When I was started learning more from the operating system perspective, I came to know that most of these devices uses Windows CE (Windows Embedded Compact). WinCE is a completely different operating system and is specifically designed for hand held or minimal devices. But one thing should be appreciated that Microsoft had ported their well known applications like media player or office suit to fit into the WinCE environment. Additionally some personal assistance software were present in these PDAs. It was at version 5 at that time. Later on Windows Mobile has evolved apart from the WinCE platform even though MS can keep the projects in a single tarball.

This was the ugly one among them. Though I liked this one too. But after all, I didn’t purchased any of these. May be not this economy :)
