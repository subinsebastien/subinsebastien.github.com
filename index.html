<p><a href="http://docospot.dk/"><strong>Docospot</strong></a> <em>(June 2012)</em> &#x2014; A software to track progress and to formally document the steps taken during any sort of handyman work done. I worked on the initial version of the Android application and the backend system using Cloud code. The application had a unique data synchronisation feature to keep the data on multiple field devices in sync. It had GPS support, phone dealer and a language switch mechanism.</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.itcraft.android.laundrycenter"><strong>TLC Client</strong></a> <em>(December 2012)</em> &#x2014; TLC Client app is a mobile solution for vehicles in a laundry company, where baggage pickups and delivery process is optimised to achieve minimum cost. It also includes a small library to connect with a bluetooth POS printer. The printer functionality is done by implementing EPSON POS protocol on Android side.</p>
<p><a href="http://xprtly.com/"><strong>Xprtly!</strong></a> <em>(April 2013)</em> &#x2014; I worked as a part time PhoneGap developer for this project. The system provided a way to connect software users to both knowledge-base as well as software experts to solve problems or questions which arises when they are using a software. The system also included a way to enrol third party consultants to enrol as software experts, and help users for a payment.</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tensorapps.picnroll"><strong>Pic-N-Roll</strong></a> <em>(November 2013)</em> &#x2014; I have worked on this cool Android app as a contractor. The app provided a secure and encrypted way to share your images with specific people and groups like family and friends. The app used code based security to unlock image albums. Only the users who knows the key will be able to unlock a picture album and view images in it.</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.xtel.quitq.app"><strong>Quitq</strong></a> <em>(March 2014)</em> &#x2014; A fully fledged commerce system for FMCC ordering. The backend was built on Parse.com as an ExpressJS app, and the client side app was available on Android. The system had the facility to enrol local grocery shops and the facility to place orders directly to the shops. The mobile phone number verification system was built using Twilio. I worked on this project end-to-end, including the UI/UX design, programming, as well as helping in engaging a batch of users.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.turboviz.com/"><strong>Turboviz</strong></a> <em>(November 2014)</em> &#x2014; A PhoneGap project which again used by delivery agents of courier companies. The application runs on a custom rugged industrial Android device with barcode scanner from Chainway. I worked on the barcode scanner by using the experience from TLC Client project. The app was later ported to native Android by other developers.</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.entri.entrime"><strong>Entri.me</strong></a> <em>(March 2015)</em> &#x2014; A personal training Android app for students who prepare for competitive exams. I built the entire Android application, except the UI design. I have also contributed to the JSON api design, and contributed a number of positive suggestions during the development of this application. The app is used and loved by thousands of students.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/subinsebastien/kyll"><strong>Kyll</strong></a> <em>(November 2016)</em> &#x2014; A simple and tiny blog engine. Primarily inspired by Jekyll and Pelican. Markdown documents are converted using <a href="http://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> internally. This is a command-line based program and it is written completely in Node.JS. This personal website, and blog posts are built using Kyll.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/subinsebastien/primserver"><strong>Prim-Server</strong></a> <em>(November 2016)</em> &#x2014; The original intent of the project is to create a mobile app client for the <a href="https://github.com/fogleman/primitive/">Primitive</a> OSS project. The app directly upload files to an S3 bucket, and a Lambda function is triggered by it. The function pushes a message to an SQS queue, which will be polled by a worker process running on an EC2 instance. Subsequenctly it takes the file from S3, and passes it onto the primitive program. The final output is sent to the user as an FCM notification.</p>
