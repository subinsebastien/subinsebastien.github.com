    <p>Reading time : Less than an hour
It has been more than a week since the Malaysian Airline Flight-370 has been missing after its successful take off from a Malaysian airport. I have been closely researching on the topic since it came as a shocking news to me as well as I was amazed how modern technology is limited when it comes to situations like these. The aircraft was a passenger jet boarded with 239 people including crew and pilots, and it was an ER series (stands for Extended Range) Boeing 777 which is usually used in 9/11 kind of attacks. I live in India and one US diplomat speculated that the same flight could have been hijacked to execute an attack similar to 9/11 in an Indian city. I’m trying to analyse as much information as available to see what could have happened to the air plane and a set of events happened in the past 10 days.</p>

<p>The aircraft went into the missing status on 8th of March 2014. It was a very normal international flight from Malaysia to China registered as 9M-MRO and marked as Flight-370 enroute Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The airlines issued a statement exactly after 5 hours 56 minutes from the last contact with the airplane. Speculation have been raising ever since the missing plane could have been actually subjected to hijack, sabotage, pilot suicide or even a technical error that crashed the plane into some deeper region of the surrounding sea area. 
To get a better picture about the missing, the initial event timeline needs to be studied deeply. The missing aircraft is a Boeing 777, a total of 1178 of them are produced and is under operation as of February 2014. The particular variant registered as 9M-MRO was a 777-200ER, which is an extended range version of the 777-200 base model. There are 412 (or more) 777-200ERs in fully functional airline operations out of 422 total deliveries. This particular variant 200ER can fly 4605 kilometres more than the base model and has more take of weight capacity. One thing to be noted here is that, in general cases, ER series aircrafts has larger fuel tanks. Among four aircrafts used in 9/11 attacks, two aircrafts which took down the twin towers of world trade centre was ERs. Since they can carry more fuel, the more damage it can cause to the target by the aviation oil burning.</p>

<p>This doesn’t mean that the aircraft could actually have hijacked for an attack similar to 9/11, but considering it as a possible option for someone so inclined to do so. On the other hand, this aircraft cannot be considered as a state of the art machine in terms os security. There were three total loss (hull loss) happened to the Boeing 777 series aircraft, where all three of them happened to 777-200ER. That is around 0.7% percent of 777-200ERs were involved in hull loss accidents. So it could be an accident which happened in a remote and yet-to-uncover location inside the circle with 14000 kilometres radius. </p>

<p>Why it is wise to rule out a crash possibility?
Again, most search operations relies on the possibility of a crash landing, and most of them believes the crash happened in sea, and they are looking for debris in the Malacca Strait on the initial stages of the search. Infact, there is an equipment that is fitted on most commercial aircrafts, that is an Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT). Again, the ELT on the MA370 was made by Honeywell, and is highly reprogrammable. Designed to provide emergency transmission for aircraft flying over land, Honeywell’s RESCU 406® AFN Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) automatically transmits a digitally encoded signal upon impact in the event of a crash. As per their documentation, this device has triple frequency transmitter (121.5/243/406.028 MHz) and 50 hours of battery life. It works independent of the other subsystems. It also has a USA Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification. It is a quite reliable device, and it is affirmative to think that, if the plane has crashed, this equipment would have actually worked. Since, there was no pick ups reported for these signals, it could be either that the plane has not yet crashed, or the search squad has failed to pick up the signal.</p>

<p>Before getting deep into the actual missing event of the flight, it is worth checking how an aircraft is generally tracked and what happened with Flight-370.</p>

<p>The location tracking and Identification process</p>

<p>GPS systems as we see on our mobile phones are generally not used in ground controls due to different security reasons. Indeed, there is an onboard GPS device which can obtain its own location by contacting GPS satellites. This information is available to a pilot and is typically handed over to any request parties such as Air traffic control operators. To fully understand this concept, it should be learned how ATCs work. Air traffic control centres are operated associated to every airport in the world. Its primary job is to make use of the limited number of runways and airstrips to be allotted to various aircrafts that intents to land in the airport or leave the same. Also, it has to avoid collision between aircrafts both on the ground as well as mid-air. To do this, ATC operated two types of RADARS. First is the primary RADAR or the classic RADAR which picks up reflections of signals it emits, from any flying objects. It could be aircrafts, balloons, birds or even UFOs. Primary RADARs does not require permission from the tracked object to identify its presence. The associated system is a secondary RADAR, which acts in the following pattern.
ATC detects a signature on its primary RADAR systems
They subsequently tries to contact the aircraft using a specific communication mode generally called an interrogation or squawking.
The pilot picks up the GPS locations of the aircraft and adds it with an Aircraft identification address associated with the airline registration.
Pilot sends this data through a device called a Transponder (stands for transmitter responder)
If the transponder onboard the aircraft does not support altitude information, the pilot manually reports the altitude as well.
The ATC secondary RADARS picks up the signals from transponders and the traffic control operators registers the aircraft on their systems for further proceedings.
The aircraft registration is usually kept live in the ATC till the aircraft enters another ATC records. It is quite obvious from the above step that, the transponders are key components in this procedure.</p>

<p>Aircraft Transponders</p>

<p>Modern day aviation transponders are made by companies like Honeywell, Garmin etc. Also most aircrafts have backups for mission critical electronic systems such as these. These equipments are fairly tamper proof and highly sophisticated. Transponders are programmed when aircrafts are purchased and registered. A flight registration number such as 9M-MRO is embedded into the transponders and then it gets attached an aircraft. So there are two possibilities to compromise a transponder.
It can be reprogrammed with another registration number
It can be removed and replaced by another transponder
These two option leaves potential hijackers possible yet difficult opportunities to fake an aircraft as another similar one, by completely fooling the experts at any ATC. We have multiple sources informing that 20 engineers from Freescale, an embedded MCU manufacturers from USA, and an IBM employee, were also travelling on Flight-370. Also, here is a news from Freescale’s website suggesting that they have aviation contracts with Honeywell. Although we don’t have clear idea about what exactly were the job titles of these engineers from Freescale, we have a strong trace to work with.</p>

<p>ACARS (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System)</p>

<p>ACARS is another tamper proof and reliable data link system used between an Aircraft and a ground station like ATC. It can send short messages to any requesting stations through radio or satellite channels. ACARS also sends information such as Aircraft maintenance data, generally relayed to the aircraft maintenance agencies, and also weather or delay information to the ATCs. In case of Flight-370, ACARS was turned off 14 minutes before the Transponder suggesting that, these systems were not actually damaged in a sudden emergency. There are four software modules in any ACARS.
ACARS Airborne Client. 
ACARS ATC Client.
ACARS Dispatch Client.
ACARS Network 
The first component is required by the aircraft to complete the system. That means, if the Airborne client on the plane is compromised by a hacker or an engineer, it could stop working leaving the entire ACARS system useless. Although these devices are tested against general ruggedness, I’m personally not sure how deep the software security checks are done. ACARS are generally built by a company named SITA. Their systems are highly software based and generally known good and obviously they are market leaders.
There are three associated events that is known to have happened during the first two hours of flight.
The young pilot sent a Good Night messages
A violent change in the aircraft’s altitude.
A rare change in the course of the aircraft 
Both the 2nd and 3rd event suggest that the aircraft was subjected to some sort of deliberate actions. It is unclear that if this was due to any external triggers such as to avoid a cumulonimbus or to avoid any potential threats ahead, but still, these are very unlikely to happen. There is another point to note down here. The Pilots extensively makes use of the Autopilot in cruising altitudes. To gain manual control, the pilot has to ask permission from ATCs because there might be other aircrafts using a nearby altitude. Neither of these events ware known to have happened in case of MA370. Thus there is a plausible situation that could have happened to the aircraft.</p>

<p>The aircraft would have been under control of a human onboard, who doesn’t wanted to talk to a ground control station.</p>

<p>The second event, a violent change in altitude, is worth studying in detail. At higher altitudes, aircraft cabins are pressurised by the onboard cooling system since the availability of oxygen at higher altitudes is comparatively less. At a cursing altitude, that is 32000 - 43000 feet, there is significant difference of 50% in oxygen availability. Thus in most aircrafts, at 40000 feet, oxygen masks are dropped if the cabin is not pressurised. On a rapid ascent to this heights could leave every single passenger with enough time to catch a mask, or even contact someone on the ground to let know of the situation. But there is another possibility. Suppose the pressurisation was not working from take off itself, a risk of possible hypoxia kicks in. The below image shows a mechanical pressure valve left open on an aircraft before take off. If it is kept the same while flying, the pilot would be getting an alarm when he tries to cruise.</p>

<p>Hypoxia (Medical Condition)
When a human body is subjected to a breathing condition where the oxygen availability is comparatively less, then a medical situation called hypoxia arises. Hypoxia is a critical problem since at this situation, people tend to forget things that they have even learned very well. That means, if the passengers were subjected to hypoxia, then they would have even forget how to use an oxygen mask, or even how to use their mobile phones. So imagine the situation where you have your mobile phone in your hands, and you see something very unusual, yet, you don’t know how to dial your relatives or a friend to let know of the situation. Very disturbing it is. In air crash history, the Helios Airlines Flight 522 was subjected to such a situation where all the passengers and crew knocked out by hypoxia. The aircraft crashed when it ran out of fuel.
So a possible theory based on these information goes like the following. It could be completely wrong and is based on information available all over the media and the web.</p>

<p>Limitations of RADAR Systems</p>

<p>Secondary RADARs are generally used by ATCs. It has very less coverage and usually a few kilometres around airstrips. Primary radars are used by military agencies. Primary radar installations are there in many known and unknown locations across the globe and many countries executes continuos monitoring of the same. Although, primary RADARs has to have the aircraft to be in higher altitudes since the coverage of primary RADARs are in shape of a cone opening upwards. At altitudes as lower as 5000, it is quite possible to fly undetected on primary RADARs. In aircraft history, there is a very good example of making use of the same trick. </p>

<p>Operation Entebbe and Capabilities of Military Radars.  </p>

<p>In Operation Entebbe, the Israelis had to fly to Uganda which is pretty much far away from Tel Aviv, to execute a rescue mission for its 92 citizens. To reach Uganda, they had to fly over the airspace of nearly 8 countries. Also, they had to use Lockheed C-130s, to move big cargo and ground militia of approximately 100 commandos, to execute the rescue mission successfully. C-130s are bulky and heavy as well as it leaves large RADAR signatures. Also there were four of them to be flown to Uganda to carry out this mission. So their only option was to hide from the military RADARs of all these countries. To do this, they did a wonderful job. They flew over these countries at an altitude, as low as 2000 feet. They had to spend a lot of fuel to do this, that they even had to make a refuelling agreement with Kenya after the rescue mission when flying back to Israel. But, this proves that, flying low can keep you out of RADARS in general.
In case of MA370, for those who know it is possible to fly skipping the RADARs, it would be a viable option to execute such a manure. Fuel loss is a necessary risk, although it is quite possible to re-enter the airspace while faking as another Aircraft as described in this article. </p>

<p>Search Leads</p>

<p>The search is based on multiple tiny information available from different sources. There is a speculation that the aircraft could be crashed in some remote locations in the Indian ocean. Also, some suspects that it could have been hijacked to execute a 9/11 model attack in an India city. And afterall, many experts suspects that it could be the first cyber attack ever reported to have happened to an aircraft.
There are many countries participating in the search. But there were reports that, most of them operates independently due to security reasons, and the unwillingness to share technical know-how with other countries. Thus it is not very wise to believe that the search operation is very efficient. Lets wait and see what turns out to be.
