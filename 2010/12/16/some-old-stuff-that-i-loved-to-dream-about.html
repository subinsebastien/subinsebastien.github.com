    <p>Reading time : Less than 9 minutes
When I was in high school or something, I had an inclination to small and new breed devices of that time. I was so amazed by the computer technologies that I had day dreamed about some miniature computing devices which I can afford and put in my pocket safely. I was unaware of the device that I seen on some note book cover or so was not a computer but a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant). I was using Microsoft Windows ‘98 at that time in my school. So I wondered when I see the Start button on the screen of that device. I thought that it was a mini-computer that is capable of performing all the necessary computing that I need. It was just Paint or Notepad what I refer to ‘‘computing’ at that time. One of them was later on identified as iPAQ from Compaq computers.
Compaq iPAQ
When I was able to do a search (it was yahoo if I remember correctly) I had figured out that there are more devices out in the market that I can dream about. At that point HP hired Compaq or what ever, iPAQ was owned by HP and I continued to love the device.
HP iPAQ
When I was started learning more from the operating system perspective, I came to know that most of these devices uses Windows CE (Windows Embedded Compact). WinCE is a completely different operating system and is specifically designed for hand held or minimal devices. But one thing should be appreciated that Microsoft had ported their well known applications like media player or office suit to fit into the WinCE environment. Additionally some personal assistance software were present in these PDAs. It was at version 5 at that time. Later on Windows Mobile has evolved apart from the WinCE platform even though MS can keep the projects in a single tarball.
Compaq Aero
This was the ugly one among them. Though I liked this one too. But after all, I didn’t purchased any of these. May be not this economy :)
