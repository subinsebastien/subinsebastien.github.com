		<p>Suppose you own a web domain, the first thing you ought to do is that to setup a website for it. The second thing is highly probably, setting up an e-mail system. By an e-mail system, what I mean is a complete system that typically has the following capabilities.</p>

<ol>
  <li>List item</li>
  <li>Send &amp; Receive emails</li>
  <li>Read and create emails</li>
  <li>Delete emails</li>
  <li>Filter unwanted emails</li>
  <li>Create/Delete email accounts</li>
</ol>

<p>When you want to do all these, your first choice is to look for providers such as Google Apps, Outlook.com, Freemail, Zoho etc. Some of them provide free pricing plans and upto 10 email addresses in their free tier. All of them include webmail capability, so you do not need an email client on your local machine. Mails can be managed from a web application provided by them. Without a doubt, Google is the best among these providers and they have an awesome webmail interface similar to Gmail. An year ago, they have removed the free plan, and my next option was Outlook.com since their service appeared to be almost in par with Google’s and slightly better than Zoho’s.</p>

<hr />
<p>And, now that they have removed their free service as well, I need to switch to another. Now, most of the times, you might not be able to retain your old e-mails unless you back up everything regularly. Often this is not the case, and I cannot afford another move. So, I decided to setup an email server on my own as I write this article down. My plan is to document each step as I do it, so you can follow this to setup yours as well.</p>

<pre><code>dig mx yourdomain.com
home_mailbox = Maildir/
virtual_mailbox_domains = /etc/postfix/vhosts
virtual_mailbox_base = /home/vmail
virtual_mailbox_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/vmaps
virtual_minimum_uid = 1000
virtual_uid_maps = static:5000
virtual_gid_maps = static:5000
</code></pre>

<p>I came across certain interesting Digital Signal Processing techniques past week. One of them been a problem statement and its solution for a finite impulse response filter design. I thought it would be great to put up the same as an article on the blog.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">H_d(e^{j\omega}) = 1 \tag1</script>

<p>Restart the postfix service and try out a test mail inwards and outwards. Make sure the MX record is now up and pointing to this server. use the following command to send a test mail from this machine.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align} \mathcal h_d(n) &= \frac1{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}H(e^{j\omega}).e^{j{\omega}n}d\omega \\ & = \frac1{2\pi}\int_{-\frac{2\pi}5}^{\frac{2\pi}5}1* e^{j{\omega}n}d\omega \tag4 \\ & = \frac1{2\pi}\left[\frac{e^{j\omega{n}}}{jn}\right]_{\frac{-2\pi}5}^{\frac{2\pi}5} \\ & = \frac1{2\pi{jn}}\left[e^{jn\frac{2\pi}5}-e^{-jn\frac{2\pi}5}\right] \\ & = \frac1{\pi n}sin\left(\frac{2\pi n}5\right) \end{align} %]]></script>

<p>For some peculiar reason, Google has omitted the pre-included SDK from Android Studio IDE for this release. All the docs as well as the download link says it includes the SDK, but in reality, it does not. But on the other side, it is not very difficult to solve this issue. One can find and download the independent SDK from this link. Navigate to the bottom of the screen, and click <strong>GET THE SDK FOR AN EXISTING IDE,</strong> and download the appropriate sdk. Once the download is completed, extract the archive, rename the folder to sdk. Then copy the entire folder into the Android Studioâ€™s installation directory. On a mac, the path should be something like <em>/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/sdk.</em> Once the sdk is placed correctly, run Android Studio. You will be shown the below dialog on startup. Press OK.</p>

<p>Finally, the navigation drawer itself. Its a simple fragment. I have omitted the details of the drawer selection and such stuff. You can use your own content in the drawer menu and implement appropriate behaviour for the same. A simple list of top-level components are suggested in the guidelines. Give particular attention to the setUp() method in the following code.</p>
